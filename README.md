# Planow – Your Productivity Simplified

Planow is a modern task management application built around the **Eisenhower Matrix** philosophy. It empowers you to make quick, effective decisions about your tasks by categorizing them into four distinct quadrants, helping you focus on what truly matters.

## 🚀 Why Planow?

We all struggle with endless to-do lists. Planow helps you cut through the noise by using a proven time-management technique:

- **Do (Important & Urgent):** Immediate focus.
- **Schedule (Important but Not Urgent):** Plan for later.
- **Delegate (Not Important but Urgent):** Hand off if possible.
- **Limit (Not Important & Not Urgent):** Minimize or eliminate.
- **Later:** A flexible parking lot for tasks you haven't decided on yet.
